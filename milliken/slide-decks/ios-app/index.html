            <h3>Three Development Strategies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Web Apps</li>
                <li>Native Apps
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hybrid Apps</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <h3>What is a Web App?</h3>
                <p>Web applications are websites designed to resemble the look and feel of native applications. Users typically navigate to the website's URL and then have the option of "installing" the application by adding a bookmark from that page to their device's "home screen".</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy development with known and proven technologies.</li>
                    <li>Does not require app store submission.</li>
                    <li>Common code base across all platforms.</li>
                    <li>No new hardware required.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Limited scope in terms of accessing a devices core features.</li>
                    <li>Cross browser testing required to cover all mobile browsers.</li>
                    <li>Difficult to discover without app store presence.</li>
                    <li>May require third-party library (such as jQuery Mobile) for consistent cross-browser/platform support.</li>
                    <li>Loss of quality control and implied app store safety.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What is a Native App?</h3>
                <p>Native apps live on the device and are accessed via icons or shortcuts loaded on the device's homescreen. Native apps are typically managed by a third party app store (Apple App Store, Google Play, etc).</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to all of a device's core features.</li>
                    <li>Support for gestures (including multi-gesture support) supported natively through the device's OS.</li>
                    <li>Full app store support and management.</li>
                    <li>Provided with SDK for easy development.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tedious and sometimes length approval processes.</li>
                    <li>Not transferable from one brand to another.</li>
                    <li>May need additional hardware to support the native SDK's.</li>
                    <li>Must have knowledge of addition development language(s).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What is a Hybrid App?</h3>
                <p>Hybrid apps are a combination of web apps and native apps. They are typically considered a sub-category of native apps. The hybrid app is a native web frame, inside of which a website is rendered. This "app-wrapping" provides a native environment for your website to live and operate, allowing access to additional device functionality lost with web app development.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to most of the device's core features.</li>
                    <li>Full app store support and management.</li>
                    <li>Provided with SDK for easy "app wrapping" development.</li>
                    <li>Easy development and conversion with known and proven technologies.</li>
                    <li>Minimal reformatting to move existing web app into the hybrid app environment.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tedious and sometimes length approval processes.</li>
                    <li>Must be compiled and built for multiple platforms (iOS, Android, etc).</li>
                    <li>May need additional hardware to support the native SDK's.</li>

            <h3>Milliken Floor Covering Sales App</h3>
            <a href="https://www.fcdapps.com" target="_blank">Web App v1.0</a>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Application had to perform on the iPhone/iPad.</li>
                <li>Product information had to be searchable.</li>
                <li>Extended details about a selected product had to be viewable.</li>
                <li>Sales documents had to be incorporated for quick viewing.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Development Tools</h3>
            <p>In order to create a stable, consistent user experience across the web and mobile devices, we settled on jQuery Mobile. We created our site, styled it accordingly, and provided the sales representatives with directions on how to save it to the "home screen" of their devices and run it in "standalone" mode.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>We discovered a few problems with this approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Application state was not saved when leaving and returning to our application.</li>
                <li>Documents could not be opened in standalone mode.</li>
                <li>As the DOM was filled, performance degraded throughout the app experience.</li>
                <li>Without access to the device's storage mechanism's, little could be cached client side for performance improvements.</li>
                <li>Fetching the product information multiple times caused slow performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>(&alpha; Release)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Application performs faster especially on older devices (iPhone 3GS, etc).</li>
                <li>PDFS can not be viewed in the application itself.</li>
                <li>Look and feel more consistent with iOS and what user's have come to expect.</li>
                <li>Removed overhead of jQuery Mobile library.</li>
                <li>State maintained when navigating in and out of the application.</li>
                <li>Access to native storage has given us the ability to cache some information client-side for the duration of the session prompting performance increases.</li>
            </ul>
